# PowerShell-Windows-DarkModeScripts

This repository contains PowerShell scripts for changing the dark-mode's and night-light's states of the Windows OS (and also of some applications).
The main script is intended for use in a scheduled task. It sets the dark-mode's and night-light's states according to the given times.\
Please note: The script that sets the dark-mode's state of the Windows OS changes the desktop's wallpaper to the default Windows light or dark wallpaper.
